# Dynamic Time Warping

Learning Goals
==============

* Understand the algorithm and applications
* Understand the concept of dynamic programming
* Implement the algorithm in C

Match Sequences of Data
=======================

You may have heard someone saying "Today's economy is similar to
economy in year 1980".  What does that mean?  How does this person
know the best match is year 1980, not 1975 nor 1982?

Consider a sound engineer that wants to "combine" the recordings of
the performance of a pianist and a cellist. They play at slightly
different tempo. How should the engineer match the two recordings?

When a scientist says, "The DNA of X is 98% similar to the DNA of Y."
How does the scientist obtain that number?

These are examples of matching sequence of data.



Dynamic Time Warping
====================

Makefile
========

You need to write your own Makefile from now on.  Makefile can save a
lot of time because you do not have to type many characters when you
test your program.
